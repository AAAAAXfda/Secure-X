# Secure  X

Open source ROBLOX anti-exploit for use by all.
Created, updated and maintained by Void_Frost, with community support (well, hopefully)

# Why?

For a LONG time, ROBLOX has had a huge problem with cheaters. It is surprisingly easy to get cheats, and surprisingly they almost always work.
Some of this is unchangable, but some if it is preventable, with the right tool.
Secure X aims to be that tool, and with continuous community support, I think we can get to the point where EVERYONE has Secure X in their game.
I mean, seriously. What would be better than each scripter in the community coming together to hard-code in preventation for tens, hundreds, or maybe even thousands of cheat scripts, all while keeping the original game unbothered?
